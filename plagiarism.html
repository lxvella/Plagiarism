        <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work without proper credit. It can occur in various forms such as copying text, ideas, or media.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Plagiarism:</strong> Copying someone’s work word-for-word.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Plagiarism:</strong> Reusing your own work without acknowledgment.</li>
            <li><strong>Accidental Plagiarism:</strong> Failing to cite sources correctly.</li>
            <p>In the context of Philippine law and cases,
                "Plagiarism is a concept more understood in academic circles as an offense against academic integrity anathema to the strict standards of originality of scholarly works which members of the academic community subscribe to.” The Supreme Court has also described Plagiarism as the "deliberate and knowing presentation of another person's original ideas or creative expressions as one's own".</p>

        <h2>CASES OF PLAGIARISM</h2>
        <div class="case">
            <img src="images/Plagiarism pic1.jpg" alt="Melania Trump speech" class="case-image">
            <p>One of the most famous plagiarism cases is the speech made by Melania Trump. The audience came to life with her speech, which focused on hard work, honesty, and inclusivity. Critics pointed out parallels to Mrs. Obama's 2008 convention speech. However, Mrs. Trump used "common words" and attributed the argument to Hillary Clinton, according to Mr. Trump's staff.</p>

        <div class="case">
            <img src="images/Plagiarism pic2.jpg" alt="J.K. Rowling plagiarism case" class="case-image">
            <p>Another case is the J.K. Rowling case, where parts of Adrian Jacobs's book, *The Adventures of Willy the Wizard*, were allegedly plagiarized in *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*. The claim has now failed since the court was not paid. Rowling stated the claim was "not only unfounded but absurd" and she had never seen the book.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case">
            <img src="images/plagiarism pic3.jpg" alt="Andy Warhol artwork controversy" class="case-image">
            <p>Lastly, the Andy Warhol case involves artwork created using Goldsmith's photographs of Prince. Goldsmith claims she was unaware of the additional pieces until 2016. The case highlights issues of copyright and artistic reference in modern art.</p>
