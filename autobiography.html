        Ryan Brando Deladia is a young individual from the Municipality of Bacon in Sorsogon City. Born on September 25, 2004, he is now in secondary college, taking Bachelor of Science in Criminology course. According to his parents, Rosie Diesta and Benjie Deladia, Ryan is the youngest member of their family and the pride of every parent. "He was born with an eagerness to learn more about criminology," his mother said. Fascinated by the complexities involved in the justice system, he was attracted to the prospect of being a SAF. Since he wanted to serve society by learning about crime and justice and striving for a safer, fairer world, he's committed to that career choice. He is absolutely dedicated as a student, earning recognition for his focus and even consistency. Ryan never failed to be steadfast and pursue knowledge despite the challenges that come with it, since he has a very clear direction for his life. He also comes from a close-knit family where love and support had been there all the time. His parents, who have instilled in him values like hard work and tenacity, have been instrumental in his development as a character. Being the youngest sibling himself, Ryan has always admired his two elder siblings for inspiration and guidance from their life experiences. For each of them separately, individually they have thorny and trodden paths towards the achievement of their respective goals.

        Ryan keeps his eye singularly focused on building his own future. He also wants to make his family proud and to show others that he can fulfill his dreams. As a younger sibling, Ryan looks up to his elder brother and sister for inspiration and advice. Although they have carved their ways through life differently, Ryan finds himself walking on his path to create his own destiny. He is driven by his need to make his family proud and to prove that one doesn't have an excuse to fail at his or her dream. 
       
       During his free time, Ryan prefers simple things that will make him happy and relaxed, like going to the beach and spending time with his friends. One of his favorite colors is green, which has been chosen since he relates well to nature and the bright, refreshing impacts it has on one's perception. Green symbolizes growth and renewal, reminding him about his aspirations for the future. When it comes to food, Ryan is especially fond of noodles it is a comfort food and now one of his favorites. Whether it is a bowl of classic pancit, he enjoys the warm, savory flavors. For Ryan, food takes up quite a deal, for it often serves as a way to bond with family and friends. For him, meals are more than just food; they become moments of bonding and shared experience. Ryan Brando Deladia is one young man who has big dreams and a bright future ahead of him. He continues building his path to success and fulfillment through his dedication to his studies, love for his family, and desire to make a difference.
